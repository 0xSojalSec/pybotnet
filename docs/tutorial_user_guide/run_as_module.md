We have seen before that we need to write some code to run the pybotnet, but it is possible to run the pybotnet as a module

All you have to do is install PyBotNet on your system and enter the following command in your terminal:

`python3 -m pybotnet -t [TELEGRAM_TOKEN] -i [ADMIN_CHAT_ID] -n [BOT NAME]`

somthing like:

`python3 -m pybotnet -t 5526760482:AAGweoNtLrHEsasxnklwhjms78ytPS3U8gEO6asc -i 5590231667 -n test`
